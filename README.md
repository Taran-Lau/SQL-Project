About the dataset.
https://github.com/cwoodruff/ChinookDatabase
The Chinook data set  contains various tables pulled from the Itunes store regarding media purchases and customer data.

What was your motivation?
I wanted to make a project that allowed me to showcase some of my abilities to use various SQL flavors.

Why did you build this project?
I chose this data set as it involves economic forces ideal for real world applications and will be great for testing statistical models.

What problem does it solve?
I provided analysis on the following groups of purchasing behaviours: those who only buy one song at the checkout, those who buy between two and nine songs at the checkout, and those who buy ten or more songs at the checkout.


What did you learn?
I demonstrated my ability to work with cloud database platforms such as AWS and GoogleCloud.
I demonstrated my data import and exporting capabilities.
I demonstrated my ability to collect useful descriptive statistics form a database.
